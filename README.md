# F2_GPL_Counter
Overview- Simple website to count and remind ,the residents of wing F2, of any remainig GPLs. Never miss another GPL due to human error or other unforseen circumstances :)

Funtions-
1. Emails each Wing F2 resident a reminder on the day of GPL.
2. Counts the total GPLs recieved by each resident.
3. Displays the condition of each resident (if he is healthy enough to recieve GPL or not).
4. Can store any backlogs or pending GPLs.

Impact: Results in closer interactions for all and peace of mind for the bloodthirsty ones among us.
